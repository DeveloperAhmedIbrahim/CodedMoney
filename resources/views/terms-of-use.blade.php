                        <p class="P6"><span class="T3">Instead, digital currency is an autonomous and largely
                                unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders and
                                market participants put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially
                                anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to
                                maintain its integrity. Thus, the value of digital currency may be derived from
                                the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for
                                digital currency, which may result in the potential for the permanent and total
                                loss of value of a particular digital currency should the market for that
                                digital currency disappear.</span></p>

                                (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse relative to
                                demand and supply. For example, confidence in digital currency might collapse as
                                a result of unexpected changes imposed by software developers or others, a
                                government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies,
                                or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because
                                of technical problems, for example, if the anonymity of the system is
                                compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able
                                to prevent transactions from settling.</span></p>
